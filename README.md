# Tariff Tracker VS code extension

A fun and creative VSCode extension that "taxes" your code imports by showing tariffs on the minibar. Track your import duties and gain insights into the "cost" of your code dependencies!

<!-- ## Features

- Real-time tariff tracking for each import statement.
- Different tariffs based on import types:
  - **External Imports:** $10 tariff (e.g., `import express from 'express'`)
  - **Local Project Imports:** $5 tariff (e.g., `import foo from '/src/foo'`)
  - **Relative Imports:** $2 tariff (e.g., `import bar from './bar'`)
- **Minibar Tariff Display:** See cumulative tariffs directly in the VSCode status bar.
- **Import Breakdown Command:** Use `Tariff: Show Breakdown` to view detailed tariffs per import.
